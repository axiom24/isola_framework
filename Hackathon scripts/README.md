Po and Kei "Chi" Match
======================

Runs a game between Po and Kei bots. Dont worry you have the chance to be both.

Usage:
```
python isola.py "some runnable command for player 1" "some runnable command for player 2"
```

Example using the great Po (input_bot) :
```
python isola.py "python input_bot.py" "python input_bot.py"
```

Bots are called with two args: a single character denoting which player they are, and a 7*7 string representing the board.
The board representation uses ```X``` and ```O``` for players, ```-``` for squares, and ``` ``` (a space) for empty spaces.
